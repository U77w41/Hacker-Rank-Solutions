 
 Consider the following:

A string, , of length  where .
An integer, , where  is a factor of .
We can split  into  substrings where each subtring, , consists of a contiguous block of  characters in . Then, use each  to create string  such that:

The characters in  are a subsequence of the characters in .
Any repeat occurrence of a character is removed from the string such that each character in  occurs exactly once. In other words, if the character at some index  in  occurs at a previous index  in , then do not include the character in string .
Given  and , print  lines where each line  denotes string .

Example


There are three substrings of length  to consider: 'AAA', 'BCA' and 'DDE'. The first substring is all 'A' characters, so . The second substring has all distinct characters, so . The third substring has  different characters, so . Note that a subsequence maintains the original order of characters encountered. The order of characters in each subsequence shown is important.

Function Description

Complete the merge_the_tools function in the editor below.

merge_the_tools has the following parameters:

string s: the string to analyze
int k: the size of substrings to analyze
Prints

Print each subsequence on a new line. There will be  of them. No return value is expected.

Input Format

The first line contains a single string, .
The second line contains an integer, , the length of each substring.

Constraints

, where  is the length of 
It is guaranteed that  is a multiple of .
Sample Input

STDIN       Function
-----       --------
AABCAAADA   s = 'AABCAAADA'
3           k = 3
Sample Output

AB
CA
AD
Explanation

Split  into  equal parts of length . Convert each  to  by removing any subsequent occurrences of non-distinct characters in :

Print each  on a new line.
