Task
Given an integer, , print its first  multiples. Each multiple  (where ) should be printed on a new line in the form: n x i = result.

Example

The printout should look like this:

3 x 1 = 3
3 x 2 = 6
3 x 3 = 9
3 x 4 = 12
3 x 5 = 15
3 x 6 = 18
3 x 7 = 21
3 x 8 = 24
3 x 9 = 27
3 x 10 = 30
Input Format

A single integer, .

Constraints

Output Format
