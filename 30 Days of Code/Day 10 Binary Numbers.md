Today, we're working with binary numbers. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

Task
Given a base- integer, , convert it to binary (base-). Then find and print the base- integer denoting the maximum number of consecutive 's in 's binary representation. When working with different bases, it is common to show the base as a subscript.

Example

The binary representation of  is . In base , there are  and  consecutive ones in two groups. Print the maximum, .

Input Format
