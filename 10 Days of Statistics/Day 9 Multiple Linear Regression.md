Objective
In this challenge, we practice using multiple linear regression. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials!

Task
Andrea has a simple equation:

for  real constants (, , , , ). We can say that the value of  depends on  features. Andrea studies this equation for  different feature sets  and records each respective value of . If she has  new feature sets, can you help Andrea find the value of  for each of the sets?
Note: You are not expected to account for bias and variance trade-offs.

Input Format

The first line contains  space-separated integers,  (the number of observed features) and  (the number of feature sets Andrea studied), respectively.
Each of the  subsequent lines contain  space-separated decimals; the first  elements are features , and the last element is the value of  for the line's feature set.
The next line contains a single integer, , denoting the number of feature sets Andrea wants to query for.
Each of the  subsequent lines contains  space-separated decimals describing the feature sets.

Constraints

Scoring
For each feature set in one test case, we will compute the following:

. We will permit up to a  margin of error.
The normalized score for each test case will be: . If the challenge is worth  points, then your score will be .

Output Format

For each of the  feature sets, print the value of  on a new line (i.e., you must print a total of  lines).

Explanation

We're given , so . We're also given , so we determine that Andrea studied the following feature sets:

We use the information above to find the values of , , and . Then, we find the value of  for each of the  feature sets.
