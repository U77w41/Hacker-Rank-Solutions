Objective
In this challenge, we practice using linear regression techniques. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials!

Task
A group of five students enrolls in Statistics immediately after taking a Math aptitude test. Each student's Math aptitude test score, , and Statistics course grade, , can be expressed as the following list of  points:

If a student scored an  on the Math aptitude test, what grade would we expect them to achieve in Statistics? Determine the equation of the best-fit line using the least squares method, then compute and print the value of  when .

Input Format

There are five lines of input; each line contains two space-separated integers describing a student's respective  and  grades:

95 85
85 95
80 70
70 65
60 70
If you do not wish to read this information from stdin, you can hard-code it into your program.

Output Format

Print a single line denoting the answer, rounded to a scale of  decimal places (i.e.,  format).
